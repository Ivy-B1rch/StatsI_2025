	\section*{Question 1: Political Science}
		\vspace{.25cm}
	The following table was created using the data from a study run in a major Latin American city.\footnote{Fried, Lagunes, and Venkataramani (2010). ``Corruption and Inequality at the Crossroad: A Multimethod Study of Bribery and Discrimination in Latin America. \textit{Latin American Research Review}. 45 (1): 76-97.} As part of the experimental treatment in the study, one employee of the research team was chosen to make illegal left turns across traffic to draw the attention of the police officers on shift. Two employee drivers were upper class, two were lower class drivers, and the identity of the driver was randomly assigned per encounter. The researchers were interested in whether officers were more or less likely to solicit a bribe from drivers depending on their class (officers use phrases like, ``We can solve this the easy way'' to draw a bribe). The table below shows the resulting data.

\newpage
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
		& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
		\\[-1.8ex] 
		\hline \\[-1.8ex]
		Upper class & 14 & 6 & 7 \\
		Lower class & 7 & 7 & 1 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item [(a)]
	Calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic by hand/manually (even better if you can do "by hand" in \texttt{R}).\\
	\vspace{7cm}
	#like all good computer scientists i do my best to never do anything in my head ever
	NSTotal <- sum(14,7) #column 1 total
	BRTotal <- sum(6,7) #column 2 total
	STotal <- sum(7,1) #column 3 total
	UCTotal <-sum(14,6,7) #row 1 total
	LCTotal <-sum(7,7,1) #row 2 total
	
	grandtotal <- sum(UCTotal,LCTotal)
	
	#set up frequencies
	f1e <-(NSTotal/grandtotal)*UCTotal
	f2e <- (BRTotal/grandtotal)*UCTotal
	f3e <- (STotal/grandtotal)*UCTotal
	f4e <- (NSTotal/grandtotal)*LCTotal
	f5e <- (BRTotal/grandtotal)*LCTotal
	f6e <- (STotal/grandtotal)*LCTotal
	
	#sum together observed frequency minus estimated frequency squared divided by estimated frequency 
	chisquare <- sum(((14-f1e)^2)/f1e, 
	((6-f2e)^2)/f2e, 
	((7-f3e)^2)/f3e, 
	((7-f4e)^2)/f4e, 
	((7-f5e)^2)/f5e,
	((1-f4e)^2)/f6e
	)
	chisquare
	
	The Chisquare is 17.37153
	
	\item [(b)]
	Now calculate the p-value from the test statistic you just created (in \texttt{R}).\footnote{Remember frequency should be $>$ 5 for all cells, but let's calculate the p-value here anyway.}  What do you conclude if $\alpha = 0.1$?\\
	
	pvalue <- pchisq(chisquare,3,lower.tail= FALSE)
	pvalue
	
	The P Value is 0.0005926672. if Alpha is 0.1, we can reject the null hypothesis due to the P value being below the Alpha 
	\newpage
	\item [(c)] Calculate the standardized residuals for each cell and put them in the table below.
	\vspace{1cm}
	
	z1 <- ((14-f1e)^2)/sqrt(f1e*(1-NSTotal/grandtotal)*(1-UCTotal/grandtotal))
	z2 <- ((6-f2e)^2)/sqrt(f2e*(1-BRTotal/grandtotal)*(1-UCTotal/grandtotal))
	z3 <- ((7-f3e)^2)/sqrt(f3e*(1-STotal/grandtotal)*(1-UCTotal/grandtotal)) 
	z4 <- ((7-f4e)^2)/sqrt(f4e*(1-NSTotal/grandtotal)*(1-LCTotal/grandtotal)) 
	z5 <- ((7-f5e)^2)/sqrt(f5e*(1-BRTotal/grandtotal)*(1-LCTotal/grandtotal))
	z6 <- ((1-f4e)^2)/sqrt(f6e*(1-STotal/grandtotal)*(1-LCTotal/grandtotal))
	
	
	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
			& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
			\\[-1.8ex] 
			\hline \\[-1.8ex]
			Upper class & 0.161 & 3.870 & 2.828 \\
			\\
			Lower class & 0.161 & 3.870  & 34.649  \\
			
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	
	\vspace{7cm}
	\item [(d)] How might the standardized residuals help you interpret the results?  
	Standardized residuals would help us determine potential outliers in the data, such as in LowerClass/Stopped

\section*{Question 2: Economics}
Chattopadhyay and Duflo were interested in whether women promote different policies than men.\footnote{Chattopadhyay and Duflo. (2004). ``Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India. \textit{Econometrica}. 72 (5), 1409-1443.} Answering this question with observational data is pretty difficult due to potential confounding problems (e.g. the districts that choose female politicians are likely to systematically differ in other aspects too). Hence, they exploit a randomized policy experiment in India, where since the mid-1990s, $\frac{1}{3}$ of village council heads have been randomly reserved for women. A subset of the data from West Bengal can be found at the following link: \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv}\\

\noindent Each observation in the data set represents a village and there are two villages associated with one GP (i.e. a level of government is called "GP"). Figure~\ref{fig:women_desc} below shows the names and descriptions of the variables in the dataset. The authors hypothesize that female politicians are more likely to support policies female voters want. Researchers found that more women complain about the quality of drinking water than men. You need to estimate the effect of the reservation policy on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.

	\includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{women_desc.png}
\end{figure}		

\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] State a null and alternative (two-tailed) hypothesis. 
	Null hypothesis: presence of female GP leader had no effect on drinking water facilities
	p = 0
	Alternative hypothesis: presence of female GP leader had an effect on drinking water facilities
	p != 0
	\vspace{6cm}
	\item [(b)] Run a bivariate regression to test this hypothesis in \texttt{R} (include your code!).
	#check null hypothesis
	watertest <- cor.test(water$female, water$water)
	watertest
	
	
	P value is below .05, we can reject the null hypothesis.
	
	
	\vspace{6cm}
	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient estimate for reservation policy. 
	
	Correlation coefficient is positive, meaning that there is on average a positive increase in the amount of repaired water facilities in GP with female leaders- however, as it is a small number, it may not be a very large correlation.
